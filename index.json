This plugin allows you to effortlessly pull text and images from an Airtable database and inject them straight into your Figma components. Using the plugin is child’s play. First, you build your component in Figma, business as usual. Then, you load up the Airtable 2 Figma plugin, and map the Airtable data fields to the right layers in Figma. Finally, choose the layout you want your component to be laid out as and voilà, you just saved yourself a couple hundred clicks!

Create a text layer and a rectangle as checkbox next to it for the first todo item.\n2. Wrap both elements in a frame ( ⌘ + ⌥ + G )\n3. Open AutoLayout and enable it for the frame. Set direction to horizontal and adjust padding/alignment to your liking. You can change the order by moving layers up and down in the layers sidebar. \n4. With the frame selected, set Height to ‘Resize To Fit’ in AutoLayout which will automatically resize the frame when the text field gets longer\n5. Duplicate the frame a few times below to create a list of todos\n6. Wrap all todo items in a frame and enable AutoLayout, set the direction to vertical. You can adjust spacing between the items.\n7. Try adding a linebreak in one of the todo items to make it larger. The items below will automatically move down to make room.\n\nThe layout of the frame will update every second if either a child layer or the frame itself is selected. To update the layour, select a child layer or the frame while the plugin is open. \n\nAutoLayout is based on the Yoga implementation of Flexbox.

Simply save color styles as you normally do and Color Theme Manager can help you with the rest. No need to worry about JSON, naming prefix, selection, etc. Good for developing color systems, projects require multiple color themes (like dark mode and light mode), and giving your design a new look.\n\nFeatures\n\nSave Color Theme\nCarefully name your current color theme and it will be saved within the Figma file you are working with. This will save all local color styles into a color theme. Note color styles in color themes will not update when you modified local color styles, you need to manually save changes to color themes.\n\nApply Color Theme\nChange to an entirely different look by applying a color theme with only one click. Your local color styles will be replaced by ones from the color theme you choose.\n\n Import/Export Color Themes\nDue to the current Figma Plugin API limitation, transferring data across Figma file can not be streamlined. A second-best solution is offered by Color Theme Manager, simply copy your saved color theme into clipboard and paste to another file.\n\nHow?\n\nColor Theme Manager will look for color style from a saved theme with the exact same name and replace the local style. So name your color styles (and color themes) wisely. Repeated names will cause unexpected results.\n\nFuture\n\n- Features like auto update, read/write to libraries can not be implemented efficiently with the current set of APIs. This might change when new APIs come out.\n- Color styles involve image fill is not implemented very efficiently. This might be fixed in a future update.\n- UI might be reimplemented in a more maintainable way.","id":"877698871356754847","installCount":1470,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-08-24T19:58:58.884Z","likeCount":40,"name":"Color Theme Manager","publisherHandle":"40a78181_9f15_4","publisherId":"2630296","publisherName":"Derek Zhang","viewCount":160672},{"description":"<p>A very simple tool to make a selection in Figma and copy the fill colors to a coding language.</p><p><br></p><p>Use special syntax to create incrementing variable names.</p><p>auto c_${1} = ofColor(255, 212, 58, 255);</p>","id":"958718454979702212","installCount":76,"lastUpdateDate":"2021-05-06T18:26:39.047Z","likeCount":1,"name":"Color to Code","publisherHandle":"vanderlin","publisherId":"1065144","publisherName":"Todd Vanderlin","viewCount":8562},{"description":"<h1>Color thief help to generate a color palette from any selected image using the most prominent colors in that image.</h1>","id":"950021064390069245","installCount":573,"lastUpdateDate":"2021-03-07T13:32:52.004Z","likeCount":14,"name":"Color-thief 🥶","publisherHandle":"aroicx","publisherId":"544943","publisherName":"AroicX","viewCount":51172},{"description":"<p>Bring the color sets you generate in ColorBox and quickly bring them into Figma.</p>","id":"892985458731250677","installCount":2980,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-10-30T16:04:18.234Z","likeCount":79,"name":"ColorBox","publisherHandle":"kevyn","publisherId":"2684","publisherName":"Kevyn Arnott","viewCount":176423},{"description":"A plugin to sort colors by their hue color.

It does this by taking a sampling of colors from the area directly behind the element and calculating the contrast ratio for each color. Contrast considers a color passing if all colors in the sample pass.</p><p><br></p><h2>Bugs</h2><p>If you have a situation where Contrast is not finding the right background, please let us know!

It looks for colors (pixels) that are represented two or more times within each sub-region (64x64) of the area tested. This method gives the best balance of speed and results. The time it takes Contrast to sample and analyze the colors is proportional to the size of the layer you are testing. I.e., Larger layers, in terms of area, will take longer than smaller areas. Sampling can temporarily block the interface in the same way that exporting a frame might—this shouldn’t be very noticeable for smaller layers.</p><p><br></p><h2>Credits</h2><p>Contrast was made by the Maark design team.</p>","id":"748533339900865323","installCount":89922,"lastUpdateDate":"2021-07-29T15:20:05.682Z","likeCount":940,"name":"Contrast","publisherHandle":"6bf381fd_7d7d_4","publisherId":"984548590427335154","publisherName":"Maark","viewCount":2749549},{"description":"<p>Contrast lets you quickly run a AA or AAA type contrast report on all text across all your artboards at once.

E.g. for { “data\": [ object1, object2, …, objectN ] }, write {name.first} instead of {data.name.first}\n\nPopulating text\n\n  •  Populate an entire text layer by renaming the layer. \n  •  Alternatively populate a part of a text layer by adding your curly brackets within the text (e.g. “I love {location.city}” becomes “I love New York”). \n  •  The plugin remembers the parts it populated, so you can populate the same layers again and again.\n\nPopulating images\n\n  •  Populate images by renaming a shape layer. \n  •  The data source for images must be a URL to a hosted image.\n  •  Try https://source.unsplash.com/ for easy hosted images.\n\nPopulating a component/instance\n\n  •  When you select a bunch of regular layers, the plugin randomly chooses the records to populate them with. If you want them to all be populated from the same record, turn them into a component (or instance).\n  •  Add data to your library components so that they’re ready to go!\n\nRoadmap...?\n\n  •  Manage multiple data sources\n  •  Use data from google sheets and other sources\n  •  Basic functions like random() and if()\n  •  DM me suggestions!","id":"787488293482536319","installCount":1846,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-02-23T23:19:06.724Z","likeCount":73,"name":"Data Populator","publisherHandle":"ptrckmrgn","publisherId":"68","publisherName":"Patrick Morgan","viewCount":144949},{"description":"<p>Insert randomized data from Google Sheets into tagged layers in your designs.

Select one or more layers in Figma that contain image fills. \n1.

Command + Shift + P to re-run\n\nHow does Smart Populate work?\n- If you selected one or more frames which contain an image, shapes, and text, the plugin will use the first image it finds to automatically fill the shapes with the computed dominant color and set text layers to have a high-contrast fill against that dominant color.\n- If you selected an image along with shapes and text layers, the plugin will use the selected image to populate selected shapes with the computed dominant color and set text layers to use the high-contrast fill color.\n- If you selected shapes and text, but no image, the plugin will traverse outwards in your frame until it finds an image fill. This image will will then be used to populate the shapes and text with the dominant color and high-contrast text colors.\n\nNote: This plugin supports both image fills and background fills, using the first valid fill it can find. As a result, a frame with a background fill that has children shape and text layers will populate successfully!\n\nSecret options: If you'd like to text layers to the dominant color rather than high-contrast color, simply include the text \"dominant\" anywhere in the layer name!\n \nThis plugin is open source, contributions welcome: https://github.com/brianlovin/figma-dominant-color-toolkit\n\nCredits\n\ncolor-thief (https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief) for finding dominant colors and generating palettes","id":"744725347356614754","installCount":8825,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-23T14:56:22.880Z","likeCount":109,"name":"Dominant Color Toolkit 🎨","publisherHandle":"brian","publisherId":"22538","publisherName":"Brian Lovin","viewCount":223474},{"description":"Share your mockups directly to Chrome so developers have a pixel-perfect visual reference to build from.\n\n** How it works **\n\n1.

All of us have encountered cases where we need to add something to a component but don’t want that to show up in all the hundreds and thousands of existing instances. We finally end up creating a new component so that the existing work is not affected. This plugin solves this issue with a single click.\n\nFollow these steps to hide a particular layer from all component instances\n• Select the layer/group/frame that you want to hide from one of the instances of a component\n• Select Hide Layers from Instances -> Hide\n• The selected layer/group/frame will be hidden from all instances in the current page\n\nUse the Force Hide option if the layer that you want to hide is part of a component that is nested in multiple other components and you want to hide the layer in all of them at once.\nEg.: If you want to hide a layer in an icon component that is already used in various other components like different state and sizes of buttons, then Hide option will just hide the layer in the selected state or size of the button. Whereas Force Hide will hide the layer in all the instances of all the components that this icon is used.\n\nThis plugin works only on instances and not on components\nCAUTION: When using the Force Hide option. ensure that the name of the layer you are hiding is unique. If not, multiple layers may get hidden.\n\nFeels too small a feature for a plugin? There is also a Scripter File for this that you can use. https://www.figma.com/community/file/858014268242545394/Hide-Layers-from-Instances\n\nDo let us know if you want any additional features. We'll try adding it.

Our design team has been slowly pulling our color libraries into Figma, and early on in the process, we realized this was a long and tedious task. Because the color themes for the products we work on can be quite extensive, manually creating color styles and a visual color guide takes a lot of time. We decided that Microsoft's Hackathon 2019 would be an excellent opportunity to team up and try and fix this problem. Over the course of three days, we built Kaleidocode to address the gap in our workflow and improve the design process not only for our team but anyone else designing for VS Code.</p><p><br></p><p>Kaleidocode's creators are Kaitlin Wilkinson, Miguel Solorio, and Pine Wu.</p>","id":"736060893363678891","installCount":3565,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-02T23:58:07.001Z","likeCount":43,"name":"Kaleidocode","publisherHandle":"microsoft","publisherId":"1500","publisherName":"Microsoft","viewCount":102750},{"description":"<h2>With Keyboard Doodler, you can draw with your keyboard!</h2><p><br></p><p>Why would I want this?

I became tired of manually applying export settings across assets and projects. So this was born March 21st, locked up in my apartment.\n\n⚡️ Lazy Export allows the user to apply default export settings to selected objects in Figma.\n\n🧠 How does it work?\nThere are two ways to trigger your export settings to be applied. The first is a window giving you UI access to run the plugin commands. (Set Platform, Apply Settings, Clear Settings)\nThe second is via the plugin menu; this makes the actions searchable in Figma with the `⌘+/` command.\n\n🔧  Currently supported:\n• IOS \n• IOS Adv.\n• Android\n• Android Adv.\n• Web\n\n📦 Export Options\n\n✨ Export Settings\nWith Lazy export, you have two mobile options on how you can apply export settings.\n\n• Default Export\n• Advanced Export\n\nWith the default export, this follows the trends for exporting assets for mobile at the different screen densities. Advanced is still being worked on for a smooth workflow.\n\nℹ️ The end goal for Advanced Export Options, would be for a developer to hit apply, and Figma exports a folder of assets the developer can drop into Android Studio or Xcode.\n\nAndroid Suffix\n`drawable-mdpi`\n\nIOS Suffix\n`/default-asset@1x`\n\nAndroid Advance Suffix\n`/drawable-mdpi/default-asset`\n\nIOS Advance Suffix\n`/default-asset.imageset/default-asset@1x`\n\n✍️ Custom Asset Naming\n\nRight now, if you do not apply a custom name to each asset, a default one will be used. \n    📆 I have plans on the roadmap to adjust this.\n\nDefault Name String = `default-asset`\n\n🐛 Have a feature request or bug?

We work out every detail - the angle, every highlight, and even the direction and smoothness of the shadow.</li><li>Thanks to good optimisation and fast CDN, you can use huge 6k mockups and it will work fast, as fast as Figma allows.</li><li>We keep the entire structure of the mockups. The best practice is when each element in the scene is on a separate layer, each shadow is also separate, and the background can be changed or turned off altogether. This is very important, when you will be using mockups in your design it is important that you can easily integrate it into your design. All layers are clearly named and conveniently structured.</li><li>We initially focused on the plug-in for Figma and did our best to work with mockups as comfortably as possible in Figma and use and supplement all the functions.</li><li>Different colors of devices. Need a gold iPhone for your design this time? No problem, just switch the color in the top bar.</li><li>Select frames from the list of layers or use the Select on Canvas function</li><li>Convenient crop to select the desired aspect ratio for a specific device</li><li>It's free. Of course, we plan to add monetization in the future so that you can develop new mockups and pay for servers, but free mockups will always be available as well.</li><li>We are adding new mockups right now.

Read more about it here: <a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-in-user-interfaces-b47cef3bf3a6\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-in-user-interfaces-b47cef3bf3a6</a></p><p><br></p><h2>A few tips how to create beautiful neumorphic designs:</h2><ul><li>The background layer and the layer you are \"neumorphing\" should have the<strong> same color</strong>.</li><li>If you neumorph' text, be sure to also have it the same color, open the plugin, and when you're done, you can change the text color to a darker one, for better readability.</li><li><strong>Neumorphism doesn't work on pure white or pure black</strong>, because it adds shadows that are darker / brighter than the background/current selection fill. If you use pure white or black, it will miss one of the shadows and it won't feel \"neumorphistic\" anymore. I'll suggest to take a kind of bluish tint of white / black.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>—</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you very much for the kind help for the color calculation-algorithm from Adam, he built the site <a href=\"https://neumorphism.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://neumorphism.io/</a> on which you can generate neumorphic CSS shadows.

A few options will also be available to you to optimize how Paddet updates your paddings. The last used settings are saved for each frame so you can easily let paddy automagically update your paddings on the fly without having to check your settings again.\n\nFAQ\n* Can I use it on component instances?\nYes you can! Do keep in mind it will firstly apply the padding to your master component and update the selected instances afterwards. Another important note to mention is that whenever your master component updates all your instances will be affected as well, however paddy will not automatically update your instances for their respective content. If this is something you want you need to use the :paddet-autoupdate flag on the instance name\n\n* What does the :paddet-autoupdate flag do in the name of an instance?\nIf a component instance has this flag in it's name Paddet wil update the instance for it's content whenever Paddet is used on the master component.\n\n* What does using :paddet-ignore in my layer name do?\nThis flag will ensure Paddet does not take into account that layer when it is calculating the width and height of the current content. This is especially useful when you have a seperate layer for your background as you do not want this layer to be taken into account as actual content.\n\n* What does using :paddet-resize in my layer name do?\nUsing the resize flag will tell Paddet to resize it along with your frame.  As with the ignore flag, this is useful when you have a background layer.\n\n* Can I combine the ignore and resize flags?\nYes you can.\n\n* Will Paddet remember my settings?\nYes, whenever you update a frame with Paddet it will save your last used settings for that specific frame. This way you can use the \"Auto update padding\" option to easily re-update your paddings without having to open the complete plugin.","id":"734548932196004433","installCount":14381,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-08-24T10:08:58.118Z","likeCount":81,"name":"Paddet","publisherHandle":"liam","publisherId":"74154","publisherName":"Liam Martens","viewCount":369969},{"description":"❖ OVERVIEW\nPaddi helps you to set paddings for a Group, a Frame, or a Component. When you specify the padding values in the component name you can change the elements inside the component and apply the paddings in one click. The component will automatically resize itself so that it surrounds all other elements within the component according to padding values.\n\nSpecify the padding values within the component group or frame name. E.g. button [12 24]. The format of the padding values is in the same order as CSS.\n\n❖ FEATURES\n✅ Paddi works with Groups, Frames, Components, Libraries.\n✅ Paddi is simple! The only thing you need to do is specify the paddings in the component name\n✅ Recognize components with paddings looking at their names. ⚡️ It works the same as in CSS.\n✅ Paddi is flexible. No limitation there, set the same padding for all sides [12] or different for each one [12 24 14 32].\n✅ Paddi uses a base element as a parent and calculates paddings from it.\n✅ Speed up your workflow! You don’t need to open plugin settings all the time you need to update paddings. You only need to rename the component and run the Paddi.\n✅ Natural master & instance behavior. If you change master component paddings, you don’t need to do anything else to update instances, Paddi will update all instances automatically.\n✅ Paddi works with libraries. Create a master component in your library file and apply the padding for all its instances in any project file. ⚠️ If you change padding for the master component in the library you will have to update all instances in the other files manually.\n\n❖ PADDINGS\nPadding values sets by clockwise from top to left sides. It works the same as in CSS. Examples:\n- [12] - padding for all sides - 12px\n- [12 24] - top&bottom - 12px, right&left - 24 px\n- [12 24 32] - top - 12px, right&left - 24px, bottom - 32px\n- [12 24 32 16] - top - 12px, right - 24px, bottom - 32px, left - 16px\n\n❖ FORMATS\nWe recommend to use space for separating padding values to keep it simple, however, you can use a comma as well. Examples:\n- [12 24]\n- [12, 24, 24, 12]\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A GROUP\n1. Create a rectangle. This element will be the base of the component\n2. Put some text or another shape inside the rectangle\n3. Group these elements\n4. Select the Group and whether rename the Group by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Group\n6. Select the Group and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A FRAME\n1. Write some text or create a shape\n2. Wrap it with a Frame\n3. ⚠️ In case you have only one element in the Frame the paddings will calculate from the Frame to its element. ⚠️ In case you have more than 1 element inside the Frame and want to use this Frame as the base you need to wrap all its elements with a Group\n4. Select the Frame and whether rename the Frame by adding e.g. [16 32] at the end of the name or just run Paddi to apply the default values - [12 24]\n5. Change text or resize elements inside the Frame\n6. Select the Frame and run Paddi again to apply the paddings\n\n❖ SET PADDINGS FOR A COMPONENT\n1. After you have a Group with some paddings create a master component from it\n2. Set constraints for the master component to make sure its instances will responsive correctly. Set Scale for the base and make sure all other elements have Left and Top\n3. Change elements and run Paddi. ⚠️ Because you can’t change elements position in an instance you will be able to change only the text elements and then apply the paddings\n\n❖ IGNORE\nTo ignore some elements in your component, rename the necessary ones with [ignore] or [nopaddi] at the end of its name.\n\n❖ IMPORTANT TO KNOW\n⚠️ The lowest element in a group or frame is going to be the base of the component! So don't forget to add a base.\n⚠️ The base element in your component will be marked as (base) in the layer name.\n⚠️ You can’t change paddings for instance because you can’t change its elements positioning. To handle it, go to the master component or detach the instance.\n⚠️ If you want to set a Frame as a base and specify paddings for it, wrap all elements inside this frame in a group to have only one element in the frame and then apply Paddi.\n\n❖ WHERE TO USE\n✅ Buttons\n✅ Tab items\n✅ Navigation items\n✅ Dropdown menus\n✅ Tags / Pils / Badges\n✅ Tooltips / Popovers\n✅ Icons\n✅ UI Cards\n✅ Modal dialogs\n✅ Sections\n✅ Etc.\n\n❖ SHORTCUT FOR MAC OS\nTo speed up your workflow add a shortcut to Paddi. It takes a minute to set up but keeps a lot of time later on.\nOpen System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts tab -> App Shortcuts -> Add new:\n1. Application: Figma\n2. Menu Title: Paddi\n3. Keyboard shortcut: cmd+shift+P (You can use your own)\n\n---\n\n😎 MADE BY\nOleksandr Telnov & Mikhail Voloshin at Dumka.io","id":"746314565953874339","installCount":4316,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-10-25T10:50:34.888Z","likeCount":41,"name":"Paddi","publisherHandle":"dumkaio","publisherId":"1312969","publisherName":"Oleksandr Telnov","viewCount":113921},{"description":"<p>Set up three types of padding and manage them centrally.</p><p>设置三种 Padding 并集中管理。</p><p><br></p><p>1.

To open this menu on Mac, use <strong>Cmd + / </strong>or <strong>Cmd + P</strong>. On Windows, use <strong>Ctrl + /</strong> or <strong>Ctrl + P</strong>. With this menu open, you can type a command and hit enter to quickly generate random numbers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[-] Type a valid prefix before the command</strong></p><p><strong>‣ g </strong>| For example: <strong>g</strong>100 / <strong>g</strong>thousand / <strong>g </strong>saved</p><p><strong>‣ rng </strong>| For example: <strong>rng </strong>10000 / <strong>rng</strong> million / <strong>rng</strong> saved</p><p><strong>‣ random </strong>| For example: <strong>random</strong>10 / <strong>random</strong> hundred / <strong>random</strong>saved</p><p><strong>‣ num </strong>| For example: <strong>num </strong>1000000 / <strong>num</strong>hundredthousand / <strong>num</strong>saved</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ [-]10, [-]100, ... , [-]1000000</strong></p><p>This will generate random numbers for all selected text layers between 1 and whatever amount of zeros you typed. For example, pressing <strong>Cmd + /, </strong>typing <strong>g100000, </strong>and hitting <strong>Enter</strong> will generate numbers between 1 - 100,000.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ [-] ten, [-] hundred, ... , [-] million</strong></p><p>This has the same functionality as the above, but you can type the name of the number instead. For example, pressing <strong>Cmd + /, </strong>typing <strong>random ten, </strong>and hitting <strong>Enter</strong> will generate numbers between 1 - 10.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ [-] saved</strong></p><p>This will generate numbers from your saved range. By default, this will be 1 through 50, but you can change it in the plugin UI. For example, pressing <strong>Cmd + /, </strong>typing <strong>rng saved, </strong>and hitting <strong>Enter</strong> will generate numbers between <em>Custom X</em> -<em> Custom Y</em>.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>⚙️ Using the plugin UI</strong></h2><p>Open up the plugin UI by navigating to it in your Plugins dropdown, or open up the quick actions menu (Cmd + /) and type <strong>rng settings</strong>. In the plugin settings window, you can do the following:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ Modify your saved range</strong></p><p>Set up your minimum and maximum to generate your random numbers from. You can go really high (into the billions), so go wild. The plugin will remember this range, and you can also quickly generate new numbers from your saved range without the plugin open. See <strong>[-] saved</strong> above.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ Rapidly generate numbers</strong></p><p>Keep clicking \"Randomize\" or hitting the Enter key and you'll regenerate numbers for all your selected text layers. Keep going until you see a set of numbers that is perfect.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ Toggle the \"Only replace existing numbers\" setting </strong>(Off by default)</p><p>Decide whether to replace the entire contents of a selected text layer with a generated number, or scan through the layer and replace any numbers found with newly generated number. Text layers without numbers in them will not be affected.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ Toggle the \"Prevent Duplicate\" setting </strong>(Off by default)</p><p>Decide whether to prevent duplicate numbers when generating numbers. This is a good way to generate unique sets of numbers or randomize list order. If the amount of numbers you are generating exceeds the amount you define in your range, the plugin will need to generate some duplicates.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>‣ Toggle the \"Format with commas\" setting </strong>(On by default)</p><p>Decide whether to show commas for numbers above 999. For example, you'd want to toggle this on if you're generating regular numbers, but you might want to toggle it off if you're generating numbers for a data centric UI or a random list of years (2021 vs 2,021).</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>☕️ Support the plugin</strong></h2><p>If you love the plugin and feel inclined to provide some small financial support to encourage the development of new features and bug fixes, that would be greatly appreciated.

If the top leftmost object among the selected is a group or a frame, all the text layers inside it will be placed in the list of inputs first, and so on.</p><p>• Now you can copy multiple layers from inputs. When you press Cmd+Shift+C texts from the currently selected input and all inputs down from it will be copied to clipboard with new lines as delimiters.</p><p>• Now tabs also work as delimiters with multiline paste. With that, you can copy-paste rows from Google Sheets and other places.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Added in version 10:</strong></h2><p>• Now the plugin finally works correctly on Windows! Had to implement some tricky logic handling new lines on Windows, and now everything should work as expected.</p><p>• Starting from this version, the plugin preserves the name of the layer when changing the text.

Primary600? That name doesn't mean much. PrimaryButtonLabel? That's clear as can be.\n\nThis plugin makes it simple to maintain a collection of semantically named colors that derive their color from your base palette. Not only does this allow you to increase clarity of usage, it also lays the foundation necessary for theming within your apps. \n\nFor more details on why you should implement your colors this way, read this blog post:\nhttps://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7\n\nUsing Semantic Color Sync is simple. First, create your base palette. For each base palette color, add a consistent prefix, such as “.palette/”\n\nNext, create a series of semantically named colors. In the description for each semantically named color, add the base palette color it derives from (including the prefix). For example: “.palette/primary600”\n\nNext, when you decide to change your primary hue from blue to bright pink (good choice, btw), the Semantic Color Sync plugin will automatically search through every semantically named color and update their color to match the updates made in your base palette. \n\nNo need to update things by hand... Ugh. Just tweak your base palette and run this plugin to propagate the changes throughout all of your semantically named colors!\n\nAnd again, if you’re curious why this is useful, this blog post has it all laid out: \nhttps://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7","id":"748971588750337968","installCount":1100,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-02-27T18:44:48.679Z","likeCount":70,"name":"Semantic Color Sync","publisherHandle":"YNAB","publisherId":"1890","publisherName":"Product","viewCount":90135},{"description":"If you prefer to keep your components on a separate page and are tired of carrying them manually, this plugin is for you.\n\n1.

The places occupied by the components will be substituted by their instances.\n\nThe plugin has two independent commands to choose from:\n\nSend to components page\n(For a quick search, print snc)\n\nWhen this command is invoked, the Components are sent to a separate page while staying on the same page.\n\nSend to components page and go to\n(for a quick search, print sngo)\n\nWhen this command is invoked, after moving components the focus is moved to the components page, and all newly transferred components are selected.\n\nAll components are placed in a special frame only for predictability, and you are welcome to extract the characters from the frame and organize them as you wish. See it as a predictable arrival point for new components.\n\nAlthough the presence of components in the frame will not prevent further calls (i.e. you can securely call the plugin several times in a row), the plugin looks up at the contents of the frame every time, so for better performance, it makes sense to keep it as empty as possible.\n\nA few details:\n\n- If you already have a page named \"Components\" or \"Symbols\", the plugin will use it to place its frame.

As you write in Figma, the Strings plugin flags any exceptions to your word list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How it works:</p><ol><li>Create your word list in our web app (app.strings.design).</li><li>Open the Strings plugin and go to the “Edit” tab, select a frame or text node you want to check.</li><li>Strings scans the text in your design for any inconsistencies against your word list.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bonus: We also show <strong>readability scores</strong> to quickly check if your copy is easy to read for your audience (we use the Automated Readability Index - same as Hemmingway Editor).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more here -&gt;<a href=\"https://strings.design/how-it-works-word-list-check\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Automated word check</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Spell and grammar check</strong></h2><p><br></p><p>Making small mistakes can be a huge pain to fix later.

So if you need to change the same term or microcopy across your design file, you can do this with a few clicks instead of clicking through each text element.</p><p><br></p><p>It works similar to Find and replace features in commonly used word editor software.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Copy handoff to developers</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ensure a clean copy handoff from design to production. Avoid copy/paste errors or developers using old copy. Your devs save time not having to click through Figma files to find copy - they get localization-ready code snippets for iOS (.strings), Android (.xml) and Web (nested JSON). You can also leave comments for your translators who can see everything in context of the visual designs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How it works:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>With the Strings plugin open, select the “Export” tab.</li><li>Select frames in Figma and use the plugin to upload them to the Strings web app.</li><li>In the Strings interface, you can add notes for developers and linguists next to images of the screens that contain the strings.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more here -&gt;<a href=\"https://strings.design/how-it-works-copy-handoff\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Copy handoff</a></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Search and edit in-app copy (available on our web app)</strong></h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Unlock the ultimate source of truth for your copy -&gt; get access to in-code copy.

Tablefy will help you do just that.</p><p><br></p><h2>How to use it</h2><p>Tablefy relies on your <strong>layers naming</strong> to recognize how to transform your frames / instances to tabular data.</p><p><br></p><p>As an example, you could create a list of instances with the following layer structure and names:</p><p><br></p><p>👉 Instance named \"<strong>Item</strong>\"</p><p>Group named \"<strong>Column</strong>\"</p><ul><li>Text Layer named \"<strong>Header</strong>\" filled with text \"Name\"</li><li>Text Layer named \"<strong>Value</strong>\" filled with text \"Task 1\"</li></ul><p>Group named \"<strong>Column</strong>\"</p><ul><li>Text Layer named \"<strong>Header</strong>\" filled with text \"Status\"</li><li>Text Layer named \"<strong>Value</strong>\" filled with text \"To do\"</li></ul><p><br></p><p>So, you could open the plugin and set the values:</p><ul><li>Row identifier: \"<strong>Item</strong>\"</li><li>Column Identifier: \"<strong>Column</strong>\"</li><li>Value text layer: \"<strong>Value</strong>\"</li><li>Header text layer: \"<strong>Header</strong>\"</li></ul><p><br></p><p>When you hit Tablefy button, it will generate a .csv with two columns (Name, Status) and as many rows as the frames or instances you selected.</p><p><br></p><p>You can add as many columns as you want! If your frame just have one useful column, you can ignore \"Column Identifier\" and keep it empty.</p><p><br></p><p>It's recommended that you always use instances, since they guarantee each selected frame has always the same layers.</p><p><br></p><h2>Custom columns:</h2><p>You can add custom dynamic columns. Let's say you want to export an url to your frame listed as a row in the csv. You could add a custom column and set its value to \"${url}\". You can use node parameters as well, like ${node-id}, ${node-name}, ${node-x}.</p><p>Available variables:</p><ul><li>${url} - creates an url to the frame</li><li>${index} - adds a counter relative to the frame list position</li><li>${node-prop} - retrieve properties from the figma node object, like \"node-id\", \"node-name\", \"node-x\"</li><li>${predict:\"frameName\", category: \"frameTextLayer\"}</li><li>${layerName} - fetch a layer inside that row with this name and get its text contents</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Predict columns with Machine Learning</h2><p>Use the \"predict\" variable in a dynamic column to apply a classification automatically using the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours) algorithm. It finds the nearest frame to the row node and sets a value from a layer of that closer framer.</p><p><br></p><p>This can be really useful if your spacial organization has some meaning that you want to export to the rows. If you have a canvas with titled areas, you could export with your rows which title frame was closer to it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>An example:</strong></p><p>If you set a custom column value field like: <code>${predict:\"frameName\", category: \"frameTextLayer\"}</code></p><p>For each node (row) we will look at all the frames named \"frameName\", find which one is closer to the node and apply to this column that frame's \"frameTextLayer\" content. </p>","id":"962937914340602604","installCount":452,"lastUpdateDate":"2021-05-06T01:36:21.083Z","likeCount":16,"name":"Tablefy","publisherHandle":"kikoherrschaft","publisherId":"25543","publisherName":"Kiko Herrschaft","viewCount":54248},{"description":"<p>A small set of tools to help tabletop games designers prototyping new ideas!</p><p><br></p><p>Roll dice, set hourglass, pick randomly, create grids and shuffle objects.</p>","id":"996546054674548564","installCount":151,"lastUpdateDate":"2021-09-11T03:37:41.014Z","likeCount":1,"name":"Tabletop Tools","publisherHandle":"victorsferreira","publisherId":"951719206520820707","publisherName":"victor ferreira","viewCount":23341},{"description":"Easily create Tailwind-like color styles (100-900). \n\nColor palettes can be created from scratch or be easily updated if the base name already exists.","id":"815578663120885543","installCount":7781,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-03-18T15:46:25.275Z","likeCount":117,"name":"Tailwind Color Generator","publisherHandle":"picapipe","publisherId":"1891","publisherName":"PICAPIPE","viewCount":259072},{"description":"<p>This plugin will add Tailwind Color Styles to your figma file.

This plugin makes it easy with the magic of optical character recognition.\n\nKNOWN PROBLEMS\n* If you attempt to run the plugin on a static image larger than 1MB with a free API key, it will silently fail. Working on an error message right now.\n* Current workaround: resize the image to a smaller size, copy as PNG, paste it back onto the cavnas, rerun the plugin on the new, smaller image.\n* Alternatively, you can upgrade your API key to the paid tier at OCR.Space.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n* This plugin takes advantage of the free API offered by OCR.Space (https://ocr.space). You'll need to acquire your own free API key here: https://ocr.space/OCRAPI#free\n* Copy your API key and paste it into the plugin.\n* Once your key is saved, select a layer with a static image as a fill, and run the plugin\n* After a brief delay, the text will be copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n* You can only select one layer at a time currently\n* If an image has more than one image fill, it will only work for the top one\n* As a quirk of how the plugin was made, you will briefly see a non-interactive window pop up. This allows for content to be added to your clipboard.\n* In addition, the same limitations that apply to OCR.Space's API free tier applies obviously to this plugin, such as file size limit, and rate limiting. See full info here: https://ocr.space/OCRAPI\n\nThis plugin is 100% open source.

This plugin will do it for you!\n\nThis plugin will let you do this:\n\n1. Manage style references on a selected node\n2. Auto-update all references as you change origins (keep the plugin open for this)\n3. Export references to make it available for third-party consumers\n4. Switch contexts\n\n# 1. Manage References\n\nSelect a node for which you want to manage references, eg. a rectangle. Open the \"Style References\" plugin and a dialog will appear that let you do it. Currently these styles are supported:\n\n- Fill Style\n- Stroke Style\n- Effect Style\n\nFor each of those there is a section in the dialog where you can manage the origin style to the reference.\n\n- **Origin** That's the _original_ style.\n- **Reference** That's the style to which the origin is copied over when references are updated.\n\n## Transforms\n\nFor paint styles (Fill and Stroke) transforms are available. When styles\nare referenced from origin to reference you can put transforms in between.\nAvailabe are HSL + Opacity values. They will be applied during\nreferencing.\n\nUse this to automate your color palette. Make one color swatch for your\nbase value (e.g. \"Brand / 500\"). A darker color would take your base value as\nreference and set lightness to \"-20\" - name it for example \"Brand / 300\".\n\n# 2. Export\n\nYou can export your references to jsonbin.io and by that make it available for third-party consumers, e.g. if you want to update your design tokens in your code. Here is how:\n\nEnter credentials in settngs:\n\n1. Create an account and copy the API Key\n2. Create a bin and copy the bin URL\n\nOn the tools tab the `Export Settings` button becomes available. Clicking the button will export your references.\n\n# 3. Import\n\nYou can import your earlier exported references from jsonbin.io. That is really helpful when you duplicated your document - figma will not copy over your stored references. Here is how to import references:\n\n1. Duplicate a document\n2. Open the old document, open the plugin, go to settings and copy the Bin URL\n3. Go the new new document (the plugin should still be opened), paste the URL into the input for import and click the button next to it.\n4. A notification will appear telling you how much references were imported.\n5. You can work with your new document the same way as the old one now - win!\n\n# 4. Contexts\n\nContexts are a lightweight way to organize various theme modes within one document. E.g. if you have light and dark mode in one document, you may want to give styles for respective styles a specific suffix, e.g. `.$dark` - With defined contexts, you can swap between them quickly and then use Themer to export them.\n\n## Workflow Suggestion\n\nUse it in combination with Themer:\n\n1. Set your variants for each context (`§light` and `§dark`)\n2. Select a context\n3. Use `Style References` to map those \"compiled\" styles\n4. Use `Themer` to export and apply them\n\n### Things to Know\n\n- When setting the origin style the suggestions only show local styles, that is also due to limitations of the current figma API, given security reasons for shared team libraries. That's fair - figma keeps us safe, give them credit for that :)\n\nIt still is possible to use library styles, then you can't use the style references manage dialog, instead manually assign those style and THEN use the style references dialog in order to persist it.\n\n- Once you have one node \"under management\", you may want to change the local style but once you update references, those new ones will be overridden. Re-select the node again and the references dialog will provide you options for migrating styles, to either keep the old one or use the new one.\n\n- Once you link origin to reference the node itself will show the reference as its local style, which might give you wonders, yet is expected and the correct behavior.","id":"791262205400516364","installCount":1284,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-06-07T12:13:14.648Z","likeCount":38,"name":"Theemo - Style Automator","publisherHandle":"gossi","publisherId":"891","publisherName":"Thomas Gossmann","viewCount":119467},{"description":"<p>Crie templates das suas features e rapidamente mude para o tema desejado.</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Crie os componentes com propriedade específicas de estilo/brand.</li><li>Selecione os frames desejados e inicie o plugin.</li><li>Escolha a propriedade desejada e alterne os valores chave.</li><li>Feito!

Use it for color, text and effect styles.\n\nHow does it work?\nThemer associates published styles with a theme name. When you have multiple themes, Themer will swap styles that match across themes: which means you need two styles with the same names in each theme.\n\nIn order for Themer to be used across your team, generic information about your styles is shared on a external service (jsonbin.io). You will need an account with an API key to get started (You can easily sign in with Google, GutHub or Twitter).\n\nWatch the setup video on YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM8SkksBy3Y&feature=youtu.be\n\n1. Insert your API key from JSONbin\n\n2. Create your first theme, giving it a unique name, and then choose where you want to pull the styles from (all local styles, styles used on the page, or a selection).\n\n*Tip*: If all of your styles exist within one document, you can also prefix your style names with 'theme1/' or 'theme2/' and set Themer to generate multiuple themes at once.\n\n3. With your themes created, you can now apply them to a selection or the entire page. Remember, your design must make use of the same styles from one of the themes to work.\n\nPrivacy:\nThemer stores information about your styles at a service external to Figma. For each theme, we store the name of the theme, the name of the style, the type of style (color, text, effect), and a unique key required to import your styles into a document from your team library. No other data from your file is sent to Jsonbin. Your unique API key is storred locally as well, so if you use Themer across devices, between team members, or between Figma Desktop and Figma in the browser, you will need to re-enter your API key and your Bin URL so that everyone/everywhere has access to the same list of Themes.\n\nRemember to publish your styles before creating a Theme :)\n\nRoadmap:\n• Currently Themer does not yet work text boxes which contan multiple text styles, the plan is to enable this in the near future","id":"731176732337510831","installCount":28319,"lastUpdateDate":"2020-05-07T01:19:38.961Z","likeCount":596,"name":"Themer","publisherHandle":"tom","publisherId":"35","publisherName":"Tom Lowry","viewCount":1464262},{"description":"A Figma plugin that lets you import, lit, use and render 3D models right there in Figma 🙈\n\nWatch the video https://youtu.be/XRP-9JM7h4A to see how to use the Third plugin for Figma.\n\n💡 Features\n-   ⚡ A viewport to interact with 3D models.\n-   🔥 High resolution and transparent rendering.\n-   😽 Easy to use UI.\n-   ✨ Supports multiple 3D Object model format for import.\n-   🚀 Lightweight.\n\n🤔 TODOS\nAdd support for postprocessing effects such as\n* Color grading.\n* Bloom.\n* Vignette and Dither.","id":"772499949564209716","installCount":4401,"lastUpdateDate":"2019-12-14T21:54:33.053Z","likeCount":120,"name":"Third","publisherHandle":"victor_aremu","publisherId":"203619","publisherName":"Victor Aremu","viewCount":213158},{"description":"<p>Apply simple Threshold Effect Filter on images.

Easily send your design texts from Figma to Transifex’s powerful translation management system (TMS) to get them translated. Pull the translated texts back to Figma to validate internationalization (i18n) and resolve any translation issues before coding begins.</p><p><br></p><p>Let your designers preview the localized designs and make all necessary adjustments right away, to avoid costly delays in refactoring localization bugs and give your localization users a great UX.

Deliver new digital experiences faster.</p><p><br></p><p>Using with Transifex</p><p>Connecting Figma with Transifex</p><p><br></p><p>1. Make sure that you have access to at least one organization and one project in Transifex.</p><p>2. Install the “Transifex Figma Plugin” in your Figma app.</p><p>3. Open your Figma file.</p><p>4. Go to plugins and select “Transifex Figma Plugin”.</p><p>6. Add your Transifex credentials in the “Settings” tab: First you need to connect with Transifex using an API token. Generate this token from your Transifex account under User Settings =&gt; API token. After generating the token, copy and paste it in the related input box in the Figma plugin and click “Connect”.</p><p><br></p><p>You should complete the following plugin settings after connecting with Transifex:</p><p>Organization: the desired organization to work with.</p><p>Project: the desired project that these Figma strings will be associated with.</p><p>Resource: the desired resource of the selected project to push strings to. If you don’t have any resources you can try to create one using the action “Create a new resource” (note that you should have the adequate permissions in order to perform this action).</p><p><br></p><p>After setting the options, click “Save”.</p><p><br></p><p>Using the plugin</p><p><br></p><p>1. Start selecting the Figma layers that you want to send, or “push”, to your Transifex resource for translation.</p><p>2. Your selection will collect your text layers as strings in the main window of the plugin, under both the “Push strings to Transifex” and “Pull strings from Transifex” tabs.</p><p>3. To remove any unwanted strings from the selection in the “Push” or “Pull” tabs, click the X to the right of the string. That string will be removed from the current selection list.</p><p>4. Click the “Push” button to send the selected strings to Transifex and add them to the connected resource. After pushing the strings you can check to see that they were successfully sent using the “View resource in Transifex” link. Also you have the option to upload screenshots if you have selected “Upload Screenshots”. The strings will be translated according to the workflow set up in the Transifex project.</p><p>5. By default the plugin will automatically generate screenshots of your Figma frames and include them with the pushed strings in Transifex. The strings for translation will be automatically mapped to the screenshots in Transifex to provide visual context of your Figma designs to your translators and ensure the quality of the translation. Optionally you can disable screenshot generation for any string push by deselecting the “Upload Screenshots” checkbox in the “Push Strings to Transifex” tab.</p><p>6. You can use the “Replace Resource Strings” feature to clean extra or outdated strings out of your Transifex resources. if this option is checked when you click the “Push” button to send strings to Transifex, then all of the strings currently in the connected resource will be purged and replaced with the current selection only. This option should be used carefully, especially with resources shared by other users. If you are sure you want to replace all the strings in the resource with the current selection, click “OK” in the confirmation dialog. The resource strings will be replaced, and the “Replace” option will be reset to deactivated. All of your previous translations remain in the translation memory (TM) so you and your team can reuse them, unless they are also deleted from the TM in Transifex.</p><p>7. To pull translations back from Transifex to Figma, first select the Figma layers you want to get translations for and then click the “Pull” button in the “Pull Strings from Transifex” tab. You have the option to pull them in all languages or in a specific one by selecting it in the “Language” dropdown. The pull operation will create a new page in your Figma file for every language with the same name of the selected page and the language code as prefix, and automatically insert translations for the selected strings.</p><p><br></p><p>About Transifex</p><p>Founded in Greece and now headquartered in Silicon Valley, Transifex helps companies - from Startups to the Enterprise - go global.

A confirmation window will appear on the first attempt to translate a new page to get the parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Original/source language</em>&nbsp;is the language that you use to develop. The plugin uses the entered text as a source for all translations and reverts it without modifications when you request a translation to the language.</p><p><em>The translation scope</em>&nbsp;is a way to determine which labels you want to translate. There are two options - 'All in frames' and 'Incremental'. With 'All in frames', the plugin will detect all labels in frames, including nested ones. It will also translate all newly added labels. You do not need to select specific labels to have them translated if they are in a frame.&nbsp;</p><p>With 'Incremental', the plugin translates only selected and previously translated labels. If you add a new label, you need to select it and request translation. Please, use the method if your design does not use frames, or you want to reduce affected labels.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learn deeper.</strong>&nbsp;The plugin does not request previously translated labels from the server on a second language switch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you edit a label in the source language, the plugin will request a new translation on the next request to translate the page.</p><p><br></p><p>If you edit a translated label in non-source language - the plugin will keep the proposed translation to recover it in the future. You can share your document with a professional or a native speaker for a review, and the plugin will keep the modifications.</p><p><br></p><p>When you append a new label on a translated page, the plugin considers new text as written in a source language, even if an entire page translated. The next translation request will synchronize added text with another context.</p>","id":"880826733808822304","installCount":962,"lastUpdateDate":"2021-07-17T23:26:44.887Z","likeCount":15,"name":"Translations for figma","publisherHandle":"58f630cf_0983_4","publisherId":"880870850386678883","publisherName":"figmat's Team","viewCount":177553},{"description":"Translator instantly translates the text in your Figma designs into other langauges.
